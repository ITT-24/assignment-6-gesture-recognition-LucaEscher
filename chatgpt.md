def rotate_points_around_center(self, pts, cnt, ang=np.pi/4):
    '''
    Rotates a set of 2D points around a specified center by a given angle.

    Args:
        pts (array-like): An array of points to be rotated, each point represented as a 2-element array [x, y].
        cnt (array-like): The center point [x, y] around which the points are rotated.
        ang (float): The angle in radians by which to rotate the points. The default angle is pi/4 (45 degrees).

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The array of rotated points, each represented as a 2-element array [x, y].

    Description:
        This function takes an array of 2D points and rotates them around a specified center point by a given angle.
        The rotation is performed counterclockwise by default. The transformation is achieved using matrix
        multiplication to apply the rotation matrix to each point relative to the center point.

    Example:
        Given a set of points [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and a center [0, 0], rotating by pi/4 radians (45 degrees):
        
        pts = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ang = np.pi / 4
        
        rotated_points = rotate_points_around_center(pts, cnt, ang)
        
        The function will return the rotated coordinates of the points.
    '''
    return np.dot(np.array(pts) - cnt, np.array([[np.cos(ang), np.sin(ang)], [-np.sin(ang), np.cos(ang)]])) + cnt

Description Breakdown:
